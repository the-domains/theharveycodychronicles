Some people apparently believe this makes sense. I don’t get it. [BTW: Trump also says we do not manufacture anything anymore and our exports are being killed. That is so completely false it is hardly worthy of comment, e.g., US total goods exports are about 50% higher today than what they were 10 years ago. The US ranks third in the world as an exporter with less than ½ the population of #2 (Europe), and less than ¼ of the population of #1 (China) – we export 93% as much as Europe and 70% as much as China.]</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="39"><p>As Trump uses the term, “cheat” means other countries with workers who are willing to produce stuff we need or want for less pay than our workers demand, and/or they are adopting policies which allow their producers to deliver goods and services to us for less money than it would cost us to make it ourselves. He correctly points out that a result of this “cheating” is businesses choose not to manufacture those things here because they would lose money - the sales price would be below the cost of production. Trumps claim is that we would have more jobs if we could put a stop to this “cheating.”</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column-3e55cd5b-94a6-4c02-9fba-82562d353125" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="40"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="42"><!-- react-empty: 43 --><!-- react-empty: 44 --><!-- react-empty: 45 --><!-- react-empty: 46 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="47"><p>""As for me, I do not lack the courage to think a complete thought.

It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are\nlargely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open\ncurves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,\nRoboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural\nwidth. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in\nhumanist and serif types.","links":["https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab","https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/roboto-slab"],"normal":4,"bold":7},"screen":{"normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.09090909090909094,"$type":["sans","grotesque"],"$caps":"normal","foundry":"google","family":"Roboto","name":"Roboto","license":"apache","tags":["sans serif"],"description":"Roboto is an open-source, grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Robertson in 2011 and released through Google.
