Let's say a person (Beth) invents a pill, gets regulatory approvals, manufactures and sells the pill, which causes anyone who takes it to be $100 happier - with no negative side effects. Assume also (1) Beth's company neither breaks any laws nor buys and favors from government, sells the pills for $30 each, (2) it costs the company $20 per pill to pay for all the equipment, employees, taxes and other things needed to

produce and deliver the pills to customers and, (3) Beth's compensation (which is buried in the $20 of company cost per pill) is $2 per pill.

Let's recap: The gains from the $100s of happiness which is produced by each pill are distributed as follows:

Customers: ($100 benefit - $30 cost) = $70, or 70%  
Company Owners: ($30 revenue - $20 cost) = $10, or 10%  
Suppliers to Company (excluding Beth): = $15, or 15%  
Beth: = $ 5, or 5%

In determining Beth's "fair share" of taxes on her efforts, should it make any difference whether Beth's efforts resulted in customer happiness gains of $1k, $1million, $1billion or $1trillion?
