This scare piece was shared to my timeline a while ago. It starts off quoting a brilliant guy, who rarely got carried away, but did, and disastrously so, on occasion. An example of his getting carried away was quoted in the article: ". . . technolog

ical advancement \[enables humans\] to do "more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing." Humans in conducive cultures constantly do more with less. The idea we would get to everything for nothing is ridiculous on it face.The guy who wrote the article uses this idea in an attempt to convince his readers this could possibly be true. With this he tries to scare people into believing that with vast technological improvements in efficiency and artificial intelligence, there will soon be no need for humans, i.e., no jobs.

The article could, with only modest alteration, been written in 1900 and the author could have (with hair on fire) railed there would be too few jobs when the services of scores of thousands of telegraph operators, buggy whip makers, carriage drivers, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, whalers, reapers, harvesters, balers, messengers, glass blowers, piano players, etc. would no longer be required. As those fears faded after a few years later a whole new set of soon to be lost jobs could be fear mongered (e.g., telephone operators).

Of course, there are literally billions of which have been created since 1900, e.g., Starbucks baristas, physical trainers, Uber drivers, etc. Thanks to a culture which encouraged innovation and entrepreneurship, the average person today is vastly more wealthy now than then (and the wealth of the poor have grown even faster). No matter how much we have, the ability to dream up more ways in which life can be made better is limitless. So long as we do not "fundamentally change" America's free enterprise system, work ethic and culture of trust (or, more probably, if we do not turn back some of those changes which have already been made), there is little reason to believe that people will not be able to find ways to trade services with their fellow man to the mutual benefit of all. For that most part, that is what Americans have always done. The more we do that, the better off we will all be -- especially the poor.
