            <description><![CDATA[<p>Trump says “we are getting killed with free trade” and he threatens to slap a 45% tariff on countries that “cheat” with trade policies. Some people apparently believe this makes sense. I don’t get it. [BTW: Trump also says we do not manufacture anything anymore and our exports are being killed. That is so completely false it is hardly worthy of comment, e.g., US total goods exports are about 50% higher today than what they were 10 years ago. The US ranks third in the world as an exporter with less than ½ the population of #2 (Europe), and less than ¼ of the population of #1 (China) – we export 93% as much as Europe and 70% as much as China.]</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I love the scientific processes, the scientific method.  Human's ability to use the scientific method has served humans quit well on net. Case studies are an important technique often use in the scientific method.  So "I'm into" case studies which are part of science.  </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>""As for me, I do not lack the courage to think a complete thought. Up to now I have feared none, and if I should encounter such a one, I hope that I at least will have the honesty to say: This thought makes me afraid, it shocks me, and therefore I will not think it. If I am wrong in so doing, my punishment will not fail to come..."</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Let’s say a person (Beth) invents a pill, gets regulatory approvals, manufactures and sells the pill, which causes anyone who takes it to be $100 happier - with no negative side effects. Assume also (1) Beth’s company neither breaks any laws nor buys and favors from government, sells the pills for $30 each, (2) it costs the company $20 per pill to pay for all the equipment, employees, taxes and other things needed to</p>]]></description>
